Gaussian Blur:
1. Open the input BMP file for reading.
2. Open the output BMP file for writing.

	FILE *fIn = fopen("lena_color.bmp","r");					//Input File name
	FILE *fOut = fopen("lena_gray.bmp","w+");	
   
3. Read the BMP header (54 bytes) from the input file.
4. Read the image data into a 3-dimensional array.
5. For each pixel in the image:
   a. Get the average color of the surrounding pixels (including itself) in a square kernel of specified size.
   b. Set the pixel color to the average value.
6. Write the BMP header to the output file.
7. Write the modified image data to the output file.
8. Close the input and output files.
