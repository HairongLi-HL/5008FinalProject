Brightness Adjustment:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

1. Open the input BMP file for reading.
2. Open the output BMP file for writing.
3. Read the BMP header (54 bytes) from the input file.
4. Read the image data into a 3-dimensional array.
5. For each pixel in the image:
   a. Increase the brightness of the pixel by adding a constant value to each color channel.
   b. Clamp the pixel values to ensure they are between 0 and 255.
6. Write the BMP header to the output file.
7. Write the modified image data to the output file.
8. Close the input and output files.
