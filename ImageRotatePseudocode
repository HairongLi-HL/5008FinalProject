Image Rotate:
1. Open the input BMP file for reading.
2. Open the output BMP file for writing.
3. Read the BMP header (54 bytes) from the input file.
4. Read the image data into a 3-dimensional array.
5. For each pixel in the output image:
   a. Calculate the corresponding pixel location in the input image based on the rotation angle.
   b. Interpolate the pixel value from the surrounding pixels in the input image.
   c. Set the pixel color to the interpolated value.
6. Write the BMP header to the output file.
7. Write the rotated image data to the output file.
8. Close the input and output files.
